# Kaggle Research

This repository contains some code and experiments that I am using to explore automated model building using some kaggle datasets and competitions.

The [AutomatedModelBuilding](https://github.com/tkawchak/KaggleResearch/tree/master/AutomatedModelBuilding) Folder contains more information on the Automated Model Builder.
